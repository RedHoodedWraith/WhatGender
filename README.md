At this current stage, this software is not yet complete.

## Notice for External Contributors

For external contributors wishing to work on an Issue, I request that you comment your interest on the Issue you would like to work on. This is so I can avoid having multiple contributors work on the same issue and be able to provide context as to what needs to be done or why something is currently delayed.

I was not expecting to have external contributors work on this so soon and I am still in the process of trying to figure out how to organise this better.
